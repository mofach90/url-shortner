## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with npm)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortner.git
    cd url-shortner
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies (assuming a `/server` directory):**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies (assuming a `/client` directory):**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the necessary variables.

    ```env
    # server/.env
    PORT=5000
    BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    # Add your Database Connection String here
    # MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```sh
    # In the /server directory
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    # In the /client directory
    npm start
    ```

The frontend should now be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.
