## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following software installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortner.git && cd url-shortner
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the api directory
    cd api
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install and build frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the ui directory
    cd ui
    npm install
    npm run build # Builds the app for hosting
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables (for local emulation):**

    For local development, if your backend requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `api` directory.

    ```env
    # api/.env
    # Add any necessary environment variables for your backend
    # e.g., MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```
    > **Note**: For production, you should set environment variables using the Firebase CLI: `firebase functions:config:set yourservice.key="your-value"`

### Running the Application Locally

1.  **Start the Firebase Emulators:**
    From the root directory of the project, run the `serve` script:
    ```sh
    npm run serve
    ```

The application should now be available at the URL provided by the Firebase emulator (usually `http://localhost:5000`). The UI will be served, and API calls to `/api/**` will be directed to your function.
